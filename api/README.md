# Welcome to the Frontend Test (API Portion);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this application is to serve as the backend for our frontend
application. You will be in change of handling authentication and all queries
that you feel the frontend application needs to be fully functional.

# ABOUT THE API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have started a very basic nodejs application that already has a couple
of endpoints that you should use. PLEASE DO NOT remove them. We have also 
included a few NPM package to aid you in your development, but you can add
more if you strongly feel you should. Just keep in mind, that we are more
interested in your code than your utilization of packages, so try and only
use them if you need to.

You are welcome to refactor the code / structure as you wish, just make sure
everything works.

# HOW WE WILL USE IT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will run the API and the frontend on our local machines, so no need to
worry about hosting it! VERY IMPORTANT.

# VERY IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data that we provided you might be incomplete, so you need handle this
either in the node application or the frontend. But this should not cause 
the application to break at all.

If there is a mapping on the frontend that does not have any data, make 
sure you handle that with some sort of placeholder.
