# Welcome to the Frontend Test (MAIN OBJECTIVE);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have included a few folders within this one that will aid you in the 
completion of your test.

The most important two are the /api and the /frontend as this is where 
your code will be. The /data folder has all the data that you will need

# What you need to do
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please read the respective README.md files in both the /api and /frontend
before starting to work so that you can be sure that you understand what
you should do. If anything is not stipulated, feel free to use your own
initiative (this is a very important attribute that you will need), to
navigate around it, but we do not forsee any blockers that should not be 
able to be overcome.

# Project information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE 8.9.2 (important in order for node-sass to work)
ANGULAR 7.3.9
NPM 5.5.1


# How you should progress:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEP 1
Create a branch from master where you will work on
# STEP 2
Do your coding on the /api and /frontend applications
# STEP 2
Commit as frequently as possible to that branch
# STEP 3
Create a Pull Request to the master branch
# FINALLY
Once we receive a PR, then we will start the review process.


# Throughout the process:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you decide to use / do something in your test that you would like to
explain to us, please use the YOUR_VOICE.txt file, if you feel your code 
can speak for itself, then you can leave it as is. This is by no means 
something you have to fill with noise.

Good Luck!
