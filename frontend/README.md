# Welcome to the Frontend Test (UI Portion);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BACKGROUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are one of the flagship team in BMW and our product is strongly focussed 
on both working with large data while maintaining a exceptional user 
experience. Therefore pure HTML/SCSS skills will not be enough as we would 
like you to showcase how you would move data from the api through the 
application to the UI, then between components and finally back to the API.

# ABOUT THE FRONTEND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this application is to serve as the frontend application. 
Your goal is to use the designs (ZEPLIN) to build a fully functional
site that runs effectively off your API.

We have provided a base angular project, with the necessary components 
that you HAVE TO use in your solution. You are welcome to include new 
components | service | directives | pipes etc, as you please, but do 
NOT remove the existing components.

# FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have include a ZEPLIN link that you should use as prototype to
build your UI. If there is anything on the design that does not have
an explicit function, DO NOT disregard it. If it is something that should
be either persisted of retrieved, make sure that the endpoints are linked
up with your API. It should be in such a manner that it can be handed over
to another developer to only do the node part.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
You do not have to worry about persisting any data, but we would like all 
POST/PUT api calls to work as expected utilizing your node application.


# MAIN USER STORIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a user you need to login to your new frontend application.

As a system I need to only allow authenticated users to use me.

As a user you should be able to view your vehicles in a list and grid 
format.

As a user you should be able to order the results.

As a user you should be able to search for specific vehicles.

As a user you should be able to view a summarized popup of a vehicle
when you click on both a list item or grid item.

As a user you should be able to click on the applicable button on the 
popup to view the full details of a page.

As a user you should be able to update a vehicle price from both the
popup and the vehicle details page and this should affect any vehicle 
components real time.

As a user you should be able to interact with all elements so that 
another developer can finish off your work with ease

As a user you need to sign out of your new frontend application.


# HOW WE WILL USE IT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will run the API and the frontend on our local machines, so no need to
worry about hosting it! VERY IMPORTANT.

# HOW WE WILL JUDGE THE SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will be presenting your solution to our team so please make sure this is 
a presentable solution. People include in the review will be UX/UI, 
Frontend, Backend, Project Manager and Business Analysts.

We will be reviewing the following areas in depth:
1.  Functionality
2.  Code Quality
3.  Front end developer principles
4.  Angular Structure
5.  Data Management between components
6.  Session Management (cookies, sessionStorage etc)
7.  Look and Feel (attention to detail)
8.  Responsiveness (not mandatory, but advised if you have time)
9.  Reusability
10. Initiative on unknown requirements

# HOW YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The use of bootstrap / material and any other styling framework is
   prohibited. We as frontend team does not allow the use of these aids to 
   limit our UX designer.
2. Do not install NPM packages for elements like toggle switches etc. We
   want you to showcase your styling skills and not look for shortcuts.
3. If you do not make this available to us at the deadline communicated to
   you, you hurt your changes greatly, because our deadlines have never
   been missed in 2 Years.
 
# VERY IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember to manage your time wisely. 

It is more important to ensure that the features you finish are polished 
and ready for shipment, than to include all features that cannot be
shipped. Because that equals to no features shipped.
